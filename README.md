# JetWallet - Bitcoin HD Wallet

### Installation 
Download and install the [.msi installer](http://jetwallet.io/msi)

### Documentation
For docs, there is [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/JetJet13/JetWallet/wiki) 

### Translations
I have designed JetWallet so that it fetches text strings from a resource file. What this means is that it is very simple to add new languages to the application.

I you would like to add a new language to JetWallet, [save this text file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetJet13/JetWallet/master/JetWallet%20v1/Resources/TextStrings.txt) and follow the directions at the top of the file.
