Welcome to Jet Wallet

Thank you for downloading Jet Wallet. Jet Wallet is a Bitcoin Wallet that you can use to send and receive Bitcoin securely. You will find that this wallet software is quite defensive for good reason.

Remember to use a strong password when creating a wallet. If you forget your wallet password, you can recover your wallet using the 'Recovery Phrase' uniqely generated for each wallet created.

One of the major motivations of Bitcoin was to give people the ability to control and personally manage their own funds. This software was built to support that motivation. It is also open source.
